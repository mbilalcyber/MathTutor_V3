## Summary
This program is designed to teach you how to learn math.7
It will tell them a funny joke and it will ask the user's
name to greet them. Then, it will generate random numbers
and chose a operation to ask random simple math questions.
It will ask the user by their name the math question. It
will check their answer with the right answer. Then the 
program will either say Correct, or incorrect then give them
the right answer so they can learn. 

NEW to V3:
  - Leveling system that will increase after 3 right answers
  - Drops level down after 3 wrong answers 
  . The program also will ask if they want to keep playing or not.
